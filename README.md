# FlipCoinJS
CoinFlip javascript app

This website is a really just a javascript application designed to easily work on multiple os's.
It's purpose is to provide randomized coinflips for use with Magic: The Gathering. Specifically for the commanders Okaun and Zndrsplt. 


This also my first use of git and will use this project to learn how to use it.
